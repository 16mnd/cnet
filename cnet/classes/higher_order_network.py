class HigherOrderNetwork(Network):
    """Base class for Higher Order Networks (HONs).

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : :py:class:`Network`
        An instance of the :py:class:`Network`, which contain the network used
        to generate the k-th-order representation. The network can either be
        directed or undirected, accordingly the HON is created.

    k: int, optional (default = 1)
        The order of the network representation to generate. For the default
        case of k=1, the resulting representation corresponds to the usual
        (first-order) aggregate network, i.e. links connect nodes and link
        weights are given by the frequency of each interaction. For k>1, a k-th
        order node corresponds to a sequence of k nodes. The weight of a k-th
        order link captures the frequency of a path of length k.

    separator: str, optional (default = '-')
        The separator character to be used in higher-order node names. If this
        parameter is not specified, the separator character of the underlying
        paths object will be used.

    name : string, optional (default='')
        An optional name for the network.

    attr : keyword arguments, optional (default= no attributes)
        Attributes to add to the network as key=value pairs.

    Examples
    --------
